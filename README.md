<br />

This course builds on student experience with geospatial skills and extends it with advanced geospatial analytics using opensource and self-developed code in climate and weather and its applications. In this course, students will be able to apply their skills to real-world problems such as energy, water, climate change, and hazards by interacting with meteorological and climate model outputs and transforming data into impact-based research applications. This course will provide students a flexible and multidisciplinary knowledge and skill base for tackling other contemporary environmental problems.

More specifically, this course will help students develop their Python skills, build upon existing open libraries for Earth and environmental data analytics, and develop new workflows using the Jupyter Notebook coding environment
